# LionMQ
LionMQ is a distributed message queue system composed of the following components:

* **[*LionMQ*](https://github.com/BackendAaren/LionMQ)**: The core message queue system responsible for receiving, storing, and distributing messages. It supports features such as high availability, dynamic scaling, and load balancing.

* **[*LionMQ Client*](https://github.com/BackendAaren/LIONMQ_client)**: The client library that provides an API for interacting with the LionMQ system. Users can publish, subscribe, and process messages through this library.

* **[*LionMQWatcher*](https://github.com/BackendAaren/LionMQ_watcher)**: A monitoring tool for the LionMQ system, offering real-time health monitoring, status updates, and performance metrics visualization.

# Features
 * **High Availability**: LionMQ Cluster ensures message high availability via mirrored queues, replicating messages across nodes to prevent data loss during node failures.
   
 * **Horizontal Scaling**: LionMQ Clusterâ€™s capacity scales horizontally by adding nodes, enhancing overall throughput as each node handles client connections and message processing.
   
 * **Automatic Sharding**: LionMQ Cluster automatically shards queues across nodes, balancing load and optimizing performance through efficient resource utilization.
   
 * **Network Partition Tolerance**: LionMQ Cluster handles network partitions gracefully, resynchronizing data once the partition is resolved to ensure data integrity.
   
 * **Multi-Host Support**: LionMQ Cluster supports deployment across multiple hosts, improving reliability and scalability by enabling cooperative processing of messages.
   
 * **Dynamic Node Management**: [*LionMQ Client*](https://github.com/BackendAaren/LIONMQ_client) supports dynamic node management, allowing for non-disruptive scaling by adding or removing nodes as needed.
   
 * **Data Visualization and Real-Time Monitoring**:[*LionMQWatcher*](https://github.com/BackendAaren/LionMQ_watcher) provides comprehensive monitoring of each node's health status, tracks data processing progress within the message queues, and delivers detailed server metrics.
   
 * **Automatic Acknowledgment Mechanism**: LionMQ removes messages from the queue only upon receiving client-side acknowledgments. Backup nodes synchronize message processing statuses.
   
 * **Failover**: LionMQ provides seamless failover by automatically transferring queues from failed nodes to backup node, ensuring continuous availability.If a primary node fails, backup nodes retrieve pending messages from the database and reinsert them into the corresponding queue, ensuring seamless task continuity without message duplication.
